Latitude vs Temp: Not surprising, the highest temperatures are closest to the equator and the lowest are towards the North Pole.  

Latitude vs Humidity: The highest humidity percentage spans across all latitude points with the upper Northern Hemisphere containing the higher percentage of humidity.

Latitude vs Cloudiness: There is no real rhyme or reason to the percentage of cloud cover based on latitude position, but it is worth noting that there are 0% across most of the latitude span.

Latitude vs Wind Speed: The wind speed is mostly condensed to the lower half of the speed spectrum across most of the latitude span; with the windiest spots towards the uppermost Northern Hemisphere.
